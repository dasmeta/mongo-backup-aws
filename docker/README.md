# About
The mongo_backup_aws Docker image will provide you a container to backup and restore a Mongo database.
There is a possibility of the subsequent shipping to Amazon S3 Bucket.

# Usage
To backup a Mongo DB container you simply have to build Docker image from following source.

[Visit our GitHub repository](https://github.com/dasmeta/mongo_backup_aws.git)


    docker build -t image_name .

Please note the backup will be written to /backup by default, so you might want to mount that directory from your host.

## Useful example via docker compose

```
mongo_backup:
  build:
    context: .
  container_name: mongodb_backup_migrate
  volumes:
    - ./backup:/backup
  environment:
    MONGODB_HOST: host
    MONGODB_PORT: port
    MONGODB_URI: uri
    MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: user
    MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: account_key_id
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: secret_access_key
    AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: region
    S3_BUCKET: s3_bucket_name
    MAX_BACKUPS: 30
    CRON_SCHEDULE: "3 * * * *"
    INIT_BACKUP: 'false'
    INIT_RESTORE: 'false'
```

|`MAX_BACKUPS`| (Optional) Count of maximum backups on local machine. `Necessary if S3_BUCKET variable is not set. Default value is 30`|
